# Code for TDA 
Many codes for creating persistence diagrams and images were taken from the paper by Krishnapriyan et. al. (J. Phys. Chem. C 2020, 124, 17, 9360â€“9368).

Data used for the code is given in Data.txt file.

To create the persistence images run the code: 
python TDA.py path-for-cif-folder

Persistence Images generated are given in Final_3 folder.

To run the ResNet-18 code:
First run: python dataset.py
Then: python trainImg.py
Finally: python trainVec.py
